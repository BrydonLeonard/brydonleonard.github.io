# The beginning

Back in the darkest depths of 2020's lockdowns, my partner and I watched Netflix's Drive To Survive series. It's a dramatised view into the world of Formula 1 that's driven a [huge uptick in viewership and engagement][f1 viewership increase] for a sport that had seen several years of decline. The downward trend was not least of all due to ex-Formula 1 CEO Bernie Ecclestone's [lack of enthusiasm in attracting a younger audience][bernie ecclestone interview], which seems like the opposite of the F1 group's new approach since its takeover by Liberty Media in 2016. The group's made a concerted effort to increase F1's social media presence, as well as the presence and visibility of the drivers themselves; one aspect of that push for increased visibility is Drive To Survive. Our household happily contributed two sets of eyes to the "viewership increase post Netflix series" statistic and we starting watching the 2020 formula 1 season just in time to see [Lewis Hamilton winning his seventh world title][lewis hamilton 7th title] live.
