**If you just want to see the summarised manifestos, scroll down the "The Results"**.

In my previous post ([How the South African elections work](https://brydonleonard.github.io/voting_systems/2024/04/21/south-africa-elections.html)), I discussed how the results of the South African elections are calculated. That was all actually a distraction on the way to my _actual_ goal of summarising the political parties' manifestos.
## Summarising things

My wife and I wanted to get an idea of each of the parties' stances, but some of them apparently set a goal of hiding those stances in a sea of as many other words as possible[^1]. Outside of the risk of hallucination, summarising walls of text is a task perfectly suited to an LLM. As such, I put together [a little script](https://github.com/BrydonLeonard/RustPlayground/blob/mainline/manifest-o/src/main.rs) (in Rust, because I'm still learning and am looking for excuses to use it) to feed manifestos to the OpenAI API. 
### Getting manitexto

I didn't end up summmarising the manifestos for *all* of parties; just a couple of the more popular ones and those that made their manifestos particularly easy to find[^2]. As is always the case when gathering data, a not insignificant portion of the effort was spent on munging the manifestos into a usable form. 

There were really three levels of manifesto parsing difficulty. The easiest was FF+; their manifesto was on a page on their site, so I just copied it over to a text file. Most parties fell in the medium difficulty class and made their manifestos available as PDFs with embedded text layers. The text can be pulled out of those with a tool like [XPDF's `pdftotext`](https://www.xpdfreader.com/pdftotext-man.html). Only MK fell in the hardest category; their manifesto was a PDF *without* the text layer and had to be fed through [`ocrmypdf`](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF) to add the text layer to the PDF first.

Pulling text straight from a PDF results in artefacts like page numbers, headers, and footers scattered through the text, so I spent some time cleaning up the text files. Once that was done, I had a list of manifestos reading to be LLMd.

### The OpenAI API

I would've just thrown the manifestos into Chat GPT, but (as of writing) its free tier uses GPT 3.5; the version of GPT 3.5 with the largest context window is `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, with a window of 16385 tokens. That's nowhere near enough for most of the manifestos. GPT 4 Turbo (and its 128000 token context window) was appealing, but it's not free, so I had to fork over 10 of my real life dollars. Using it via the ChatGPT interface would've cost $20, so I was happy to save some money by calling the API directly.

What I didn't realise initially is that OpenAI doesn't let you go full speed with just $10 in a new account. They have an account limit system where the more you spend and the older your account, the more they trust you and allow you to call their APIs more quickly. Their rate limits are based on the number of tokens you pass to their models and my account's limit for GPT 4 Turbo is 30000 tokens per minute. As a result, the huge 128000 token context window ended up being useless, since I could actually only submit 30000 at a time. I didn't really feel like spending more money, though, so I just `split --number 4 EFF.txt "EFF"` and fed each too-long manifesto through in chunks. I then re-submitted the resulting summaries to be combined[^5].

Figuring out my way around the rate limits may have been a bit of a pain, but at least the OpenAI API itself is dead simple (their [quick start guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) takes all of 1 minute to run through). The request bodies look something like:

```json
{
    "model": "gpt-4-turbo",
    "messages": [
	      {
		        "role": "system",
		        "content": "You are an experienced political journalist that writes four-paragraph summaries of the manifestos of political parties"
	      },
	      {
		        "role": "user",
		        "content": "Please summarise the following manifesto:"
	      },
	      {
		        "role": "user",
		        "content": "<a full manifesto>"
	      }
    ]
}
```

And it spits back a response that looks like (with some fields cleaned up for brevity):

```json
{
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "model": "gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09",
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) 2024 Manifesto outlines ..."
      }
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 4472,
    "completion_tokens": 450,
    "total_tokens": 4922
  },
}
```

## DA

**The Democratic Alliance's Rescue Plan for South Africa**

In the 2024 elections, the Democratic Alliance (DA) presents a bold and urgent Rescue Plan to address South Africa's multifaceted crisis after years of ANC rule, which it claims has led to corruption, poor governance, and economic downturns. The DA emphasizes a transition to a merit-based public service system, undoing the ANC's cadre deployment which they argue has led to an inefficient government and public service. They propose starting by filling public service roles solely based on competence to rejuvenate the government's function and capability.

Central to the DA's platform is economic rejuvenation focused on alleviating the unemployment crisis. They plan to create two million new jobs by reforming labor laws to encourage hiring, particularly among the youth, and by enhancing the flexibility of the workforce through skills development.

At the community and individual safety level, the DA plans to halve the current rates of violent crime, including gender-based violence, through decentralized policing and a new crime-fighting agency modeled after the dissolved Scorpions. This approach aims to foster a more localized and effective policing system. Additionally, they advocate for the overhaul of the education system by tripling the number of grade four learners who can read for understanding, enhancing foundational education quality, and promoting inclusivity and excellence across all schools.

The healthcare proposal from the DA rejects the ANC's National Health Insurance in favor of a mixed model enhancing both public and private healthcare sectors. They propose universal healthcare coverage that increases accessibility without imposing the centralized model that they argue could lead to service decline and increased corruption.

## MK[^3]

**Summary of the Manifesto of the MK Party - "The Peoples Mandate"**

**Preamble and Objectives**:
The MK Party's manifesto begins with a critical reflection on the post-1994 trajectory of South Africa, highlighting what it sees as a reversal of the gains of liberation. Key concerns include moral decay, undue influence by unelected bodies and wealthy individuals, and the aftermath of colonialism expressed through persistent inequality, poverty, and unemployment. The manifesto lays out an ambitious plan to override the existing constitutional order to prioritize parliamentary supremacy, expropriate land without compensation, nationalize key industries including the South African Reserve Bank, mines, and major financial institutions, and implement extensive social and educational reforms.

**Cultural Reclamation and Social Justice**:
The manifesto emphasizes a return to African cultural roots, proposing the integration of indigenous languages and African values across all levels of education and state functions. It criticizes the current dominance of Western cultural and economic models and calls for a robust promotion of African traditions in arts and education. The party seeks to address social issues such as high crime rates and teenage pregnancy, which it attributes to cultural dislocation and the prevailing capitalist ethos that undermines communal values.

**Economic Transformation and State Control**:
A significant portion of the manifesto is dedicated to economic reforms, with a stark rejection of neoliberal policies. The MK Party plans to reclaim land and mineral resources, promoting state ownership to ensure broader public benefits and correcting historical injustices.

This involves revisiting international agreements and promoting regional integration and development within the SADC region.

In summary, the MK Party's manifesto calls for a radical overhaul of South Africa's political, economic, and social systems to address deep-rooted inequalities and reassert national sovereignty and African cultural identity.

## Footnotes
[^1]: Looking at you, EFF and COPE.
[^2]: It's strange how difficult some parties make it to find their manifestos. You'd think you want those as easily available as possible.
[^3]: For whatever reason, GPT4 decided that MK's summary needed nice formatting.
[^4]: DALL-E prompt: "a proudly south african AI political scientist"
[^5]: That does introduce a second opportunity for hallucination, but I'm not going to worry about that too much.
